# EcoWear
A web application for buying, selling, and renting designer clothing, bridal wear, and accessories, providing affordable access to luxury fashion while promoting sustainability.

## System Architecture (High-Level)

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (client-side rendering, form handling, basic routing).
* **Backend:** Firebase services (Authentication, database, storage, hosting).
* **Integration:** Frontend calls backend APIs/SDKs; data secured with rules; deployments via hosting.

## Phases

**Phase 1 – Clickable Prototype**

* Build a single-page prototype in HTML/CSS/JS.
* Implement core screens and user flows with mock data.
* Store temporary state in the browser for demo purposes.

**Phase 2 – Frontend Application**

* Organize pages/components and shared utilities.
* Add form validation, accessibility, and responsive styles.
* Prepare interfaces for backend data (service layer).

**Phase 3 – Backend Setup**

* Configure Firebase project.
* Enable user authentication and a managed database.
* Define security rules and basic data models.
* Set up hosting and storage for assets.

**Phase 4 – Integration**

* Replace mock data with live reads/writes.
* Secure client interactions through backend rules/services.
* Handle error states, loading states, and basic analytics.

**Phase 5 – Testing & Deployment**

* Smoke test main flows and fix blockers.
* Deploy to hosting and verify end-to-end behavior.
* Document setup, run steps, and known limitations.

## Deliverables

* Clickable HTML/CSS/JS prototype.
* Structured frontend code with reusable components.
* Firebase project with auth, database, storage, and hosting configured.
* Integrated app connecting frontend and backend.
* Brief documentation and demo script.
